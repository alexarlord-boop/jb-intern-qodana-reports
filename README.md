## Task Description
Design and develop an accessible registration form with fields for email, password, and username, plus a "Show Password" toggle button, ensuring keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.

## Solution outcome
Working on this task has provided me with a unique opportunity to improve my skills in React, specifically with the React Hook Form library. Through hands-on experience, I've deepened practical knowledge in frontend development and UX. 
As I delved into the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, I've not only learned about the importance of inclusive design but also applied these principles directly to my project. 

## Results: Registration Form with keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility
